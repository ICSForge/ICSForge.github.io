**ICSForge™** is an open-source **OT/ICS security coverage validation platform** designed to help defenders, SOC teams, and OT security engineers validate detection, visibility, and readiness against real-world industrial attack techniques.

ICSForge focuses on what can actually be observed on the network and generates realistic OT traffic and PCAPs in **8 industrial protocols (Modbus/TCP, DNP3, S7comm, IEC-104, OPC UA, EtherNet/IP, BACnet/IP, PROFINET DCP)** which are aligned with **72 out of 83 unique techniques in MITRE ATT&CK for ICS (v18)** - without exploiting real systems or causing unsafe process impact - to help asset owners and defenders assessing the quality of existing security countermeasures such as firewalls, OT NSM sensors and ACLs and identifying hidden gaps.

ICSForge is developed with a **safe-by-design** approach, operating within a **Sender-Receiver architecture** and interacting only with the designated sender and receiver, without touching other OT devices.

> Most ICS security tools promise coverage - ICSForge lets you **prove it**.

```

On-wire **correlation markers** (`ICSFORGE_SYNTH|run_id|technique|step`) embedded in every packet enable end-to-end validation: if the receiver sees the marker, the traffic reached the wire. If your IDS fires, your detection works.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ICSforge/ICSforge.git
cd ICSforge
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
chmod +x icsforge.sh
```

### Or with Docker

```bash
docker compose up
# Sender UI:   http://localhost:8080
# Receiver UI: http://localhost:8081
```

### Generate a PCAP (offline)

```bash
icsforge generate --name T0855__unauth_command__modbus --outdir out/
# → out/pcaps/offline.pcap + out/events/offline.jsonl
```

### Send live traffic to receiver

```bash
# Terminal 1: start receiver
sudo icsforge-receiver --bind 127.0.0.1

# Terminal 2: send traffic
icsforge send --name T0855__unauth_command__modbus \
  --dst-ip 127.0.0.1 --confirm-live-network
```

### Web UI

```bash
sudo ./icsforge.sh web        				# Sender dashboard on :8080
sudo ./icsforge.sh receiver   				# Receiver dashboard on :8080
sudo ./icsforge.sh receiver --l2-iface eth0 # Receiver with Profinet Listener
```

## What ICSForge Is Not

- Not an exploitation framework
- Not a PLC hacking tool
- Not a malware platform
- Not a process-impact simulator

ICSForge is **defender-first**, **safe by design**, and **honest about limitations**.

## Scenarios

- Defined in `icsforge/scenarios/scenarios.yml`
- Consistent naming: `T08XX__technique__protocol__variant`
- Honest distinction between runnable and non-runnable techniques
- Campaign playbooks for multi-step attack sequences

## Detection Content

ICSForge auto-generates detection rules from its scenario catalog:

```bash
# Via Web UI: Tools → Generate Detection Rules
# Preview: GET /api/detections/preview

```

Output formats: **Suricata rules** (.rules) and **Sigma rules** (.yml)
